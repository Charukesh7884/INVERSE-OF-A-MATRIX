# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : import the numpy library as np
### Step 2: The matrix is defined as a 2D array using the numpy.array() function.
### Step 3: The np.linalg.inv() function from the NumPy library is used to calculate the inverse of the matrix.
### Step 4: Print the Result and end the program

## Program:
```python
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: CHARUKESH S
#RegisterNumber: 212224230044

import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
b=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(b)
```
## Output:
